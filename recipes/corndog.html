    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) packages beef frankfurters</li>
        <li>16 wooden skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; stir in milk and egg to make a batter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Meanwhile, pat frankfurters dry and insert a skewer into each one. Roll frankfurters in batter until well coated.</li>
